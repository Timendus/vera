This is a lay-out directory for the ASMDOC tool v1.3 and above.

It can have two subdirectories: "root" and "all". All files in the "root"
directory will only be copied to the destination root. All files in the
"all" directory will be copied to the destination root AND all it's child
directories.

It's really that simple ;-)
