=========================== Asmdoc tool v1.5 ==========================

=== Asmdoc ===

Asmdoc is a tool that generates good looking and easy to navigate 
documentation directly from your assembly source code. To do so it
parses your assembly files and takes out all the metadata that you have
added in your comments in accordance with the Vera Coding Standards.

See "http://timendus.student.utwente.nl/~vera/wiki/
index.php/Documentation_generators" for more information about this
program or "http://timendus.student.utwente.nl/~vera/wiki/index.php/
Coding_standards" for a specification of the Vera Coding Standards.

=== Usage ===

On your command prompt, run:

$ asmdoc file.asm file.xml

to parse the comments in one assembly file ("file.asm") and store them
as XML data in another file ("file.xml"). Or run:

$ asmdoc sourcedir docsdir [layoutdir]

to parse an entire directory ("sourcedir") of assembly files (*.asm and
*.inc will be converted, others ignored), specifying a target directory
("docsdir") where the XML files should be stored.

Optionally, you can specify a lay-out directory where files are stored
that you want automatically copied into the target directory. See the
file "README" in the directory "layout" for more information on this.

To test this tool and get a look at it's output, you can parse test.asm
(located in the directory example/src) as follows:

$ asmdoc example/src/ example/docs/ example/layout/

Then open example/docs/index.html in any modern webbrowser to see the
result. Make sure you issue this command from the directory where this
README file is located though, or it will not be able to find the 
specified directories.

=== Todo list ===

- Add file extentions to filenames to prevent .asm/.inc conflicts
- Add a bit more error checking on copying layout files
- Perhaps fix the XML indenting in tree.xml
